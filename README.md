# Frontend Mentor - News Homepage Solution

This is my solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). This project is a great opportunity to learn Vue and practice building a responsive layout. I found the challenge fun and rewarding, especially because it helped me transition from React to Vue, and I explored some powerful features in Vue that I hadnâ€™t used before.

## My Process

### Built With

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript Framework
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - Official Router for Vue.JS
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I Learned

This was my first time using Vue in a real project, and it was an eye-opener. The differences between Vue and React were quite interesting to discover. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Vue Syntax Efficiency:** I found Vue's syntax more efficient compared to React. For instance, Vue's built-in reactivity system allowed me to manage state with less code.
- **Vue's Built-in Image Optimization:** I was impressed with how Vue can optimize images out-of-the-box, which helps improve performance without needing third-party libraries.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Deepening my understanding of Vue's Composition API.
- Improving my TypeScript skills, particularly with more complex types and generics.
- Exploring Vue's ecosystem, such as Vuex for state management or Nuxt.js for server-side rendering.

### Useful Resources

- [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - The official Vue documentation was invaluable in helping me understand core concepts.
